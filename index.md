I am currently a master's student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering (School of Cyber Science and Technology) at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, majoring in Computer Technology. My research direction is graph data mining, specifically focusing on cross-network node classification tasks. I also graduated from the same school with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Technology.
